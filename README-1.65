Chimera is an X/Athena Web client for UNIX-based workstations.
If you do not know about the Web then try to grab a FAQ from
rtfm.mit.edu using ftp.  Chimera does not require Motif.

Read INSTALL for installation instructions.  Read README.hints for
installation hints.

The Chimera distribution is made up of several parts:

src            This is the source code for Chimera.  This is
               code written by John Kilburg.

lib            Run-time configuration files for Chimera.

mxw            These are miscellaneous X widgets written by various
               people.

libhtmlw       This is the HTML widget.  It was written at NCSA.  You
               can find the original version of this code in the
               Mosaic-2.4 distribution.  Read libhtmlw/README for
               more details.

util           Utility programs used by chimera.

xloadimage     Functions for handling graphics images.  This code was
               snarfed from xloadimage which is available on ftp.x.org.

compat         This directory was grabbed from the TCL 7.3 distribution.
               It contains functions used by chimera that may not exist
               on all machines.  I grabbed strcasecmp() from the BSD
               sources.

common         Stuff common to all of the above directories.

You should examine the files in each of these directories for
copyright and distribution information.

Jay and Greg are the system guys for the engineering college at UNLV.
They have done a really nice job of setting up and maintaining the
computing environment here.  A lot of the development
work was also done on a Linux box.  I am grateful to Linus Torvalds
and the other folks (too numerous to mention) who have
worked on Linux.
