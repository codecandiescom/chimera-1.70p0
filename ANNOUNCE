This is an announcement for chimera 1.70.  Chimera is an X-based 
World-Wide Web browser for UNIX machines.  Chimera uses the
Athena widget set and a modified form of the NCSA HTML widget.

Chimera supports forms, inline images, TERM, SOCKS, proxy servers,
Gopher, FTP, HTTP, and local file accesses.

Chimera can be extended using external programs.
New protocols can easily be added and alternate image formats can be used
for inline images (e.g. postscript, JPEG, ...).

It is available for anonymous ftp at ftp.cs.unlv.edu in the
directory /pub/chimera.  Check out the URL

for a partial list of mirrors and other information.
