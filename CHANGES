Notes / To do:
--------------
Deficiencies:
  * no "rowspan=" or align=center support in tables;
Minor annoyance: the (now) rare, "spurious" extra spaces added during
  formatting can result in equally spurious blank lines in the Print/Select
  output.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.70p0
------------
src/main.c: Bookmark use vs. local files bug fixed!  Needed an alloc_string
  because FixFilename(root.bookmarkFile) returns a pointer to a static char[].
mxw/Bookmark.c: free bookmark's filename [both by WBE]

beta 3 (WBE, GN)
------
libhtmlw/HTMLwidgets.c [WBE]: Last minute exorcism of Call By Should-Be-A-
  Reference-But-Isn't.  Bug had been hidden because widgets were never freed.
README*, INSTALL* [WBE, GN]: Renamed old README to README-1.65 and put a new
  one in;  renamed README.hints to INSTALL.hints, updated ANNOUNCE.
options.h.dist: [GN] Since nonblocking connects seem to work on all platforms
  I could lay my hands on, I've turned them on by default, also changing the
  installation instructions accordingly.
src/main.c et al.: [WBE]
  delayImageLoad X resource restored; initial DeferPix state set from resource.
  delayImageLoad toggling via 'i' now works when user has no DeferPix button.
libhtmlw/*: new method of image handling, using html.image_list!
  Removed DelayedImageResolve() and related no-longer-needed code. [WBE]
libhtmlw/HTML.c: clicking on anchor of delayed ISMAP actually fetches the
  image first. [GN]
src/inline.c: CreateImageInfo could return uninitialized iinfo [WBE]
src/main.c: ImageResolve: if localonly, also load "localhost" images. [WBE]
src/net.c: net_gethostname: use MAXHOSTNAMELEN when defined [WBE]
src/url.c: completely revamped ParseURL().  Shorter, and more correct. [GN]
src/main.c: "Source" pages now inherit their URL from the original page,
  both for the display and for opening relative URLs. [GN]
src/net.c: Made DNS lookups interruptible; also cache the two most recent
  lookup results, with expiration. About 90% cache hit ratio; even better when
  going through a proxy.-- Uses SIGALRM, so this is now ignored except when
  needed (src/main.c). [GN]
src/net.c, src/main.c:
  New feature: connection progress displayed in Title area [GN]
src/http.c: "Host:" HTTP request header added for multi-homed sites. [GN]
src/lang.c: Rearranged everything, made it easier to add new entries. [GN]
libhtmlw/HTMLparse.c:
  changed ParseMarkTag and AnchorTag to avoid modifying their arguments.
  caseless_equal redefined, sped up, & bugs fixed.
  caseless_equal_prefix() eliminated. [WBE]
libhtmlw/HTMLformat.c: last caseless_strcmp replaced by ParseMarkTag [WBE]
libhtmlw/HTMLwidgets.c, HTML.c, HTMLformat.c:
  FreeForms and FreeOneForm created and calls added.  This plugs yet another
  memory leak (forms and their contents were never freed). [WBE]
libhtmlw/HTMLformat.c:
  Really Neat Secret Little Tweak by WBE who won't say what it is.
Resource html.htmlErrMsgCutoff added. [WBE]
libhtmlw/HTML.c: DiscardCurPageObjects created; call removed from main.c. [WBE]
  Resize() now calls main.c:SetTitle() to restore title when done [WBE]
libhtmlw/HTMLimages.c:
  MAJOR memory leak plugged (pic_data->image_data not freed!) [WBE]
  Related memory leaks plugged (pic_data itself & other contents not freed)
    [code by WBE, bug identified by GN]
libhtmlw/HTMLwidgets.c: minor edits and an optimization or two. [WBE]
libhtmlw/HTMLimages.c: created FreeOneImage(); AddFElement needed it. [WBE]
Widget memory leak plugged (main.c,HTML.c): needed calls to HTMLFreeWidgetInfo.
  This included cleaning up lots of confused code in several files. [WBE]
libhtmlw/HTMLformat.c: [WBE]
  Memory leaks plugged: image pixmaps in SetElement, unpopped font stack
    records, unclaimed SpecialsText, >1 title/document.
  CreateElement and SetElement merged and renamed AddFElement! (yay!)
  Table captions are now displayed, incl. align=center simulation!
  *Place() routines are now passed the mark text itself instead of a mark.
    This also eliminated a lot of "fake mark" twiddling foolery.
  NeedSpace-related code revamped to suppress most spurious spaces.
  ImagePlace and WidgetPlace underestimated space on current line in table.
  implicit <td>s added.
  bug in LF height fixed; LineFeedPlace and its callers changed.
  </tr>: don't emit LF if nothing on row.
  suppression of LFs inside a table but not in a cell now complete.
  do implicit </tables> for any tables left unterminated.
libhtmlw/HTMLformat.c, HTML.c [GN]: changed text drawing so that italic
  characters no longer end up truncated by the following character (except
  in selections).  Also numerous spelling fixes in comments.
libhtmlw/HTMLparse.c [GN]: accept single-quoted values.  More spelling fixes.
  Oh and before I forget, put two forsaken fprintf's (`Error parsing "blah",
  bailing out') into #ifdef VERBOSE's like all the others.
src/url.c: fixed ../ and ./ handling [WBE, GN]
  Fixed buffer overrun (uck) in src/url.c, MakeURL.  We can now deal with
  fragment ids (called "anchors" in the source) of arbitrary length [GN].
xloadimage/gif.c: gifLoad forgot to call gifin_cleanup() on early errors. [WBE]
  Fixes problem of a failed image load preventing all further image display.
Fully functional mailto.pl helper script is now in the distribution and
  activated by default  (although it needs perl).  Documentation updated [GN].

beta 2 (WBE)
------
Integrated the April 17, 1997 "1.65p[12]" patches by
    Jim Rees <rees@citi.umich.edu>,
    Gerhard Niklasch <nikl@mathematik.tu-muenchen.de>
    and many others.
  Fixed inlined images on 32bpp X servers [GN]
  Pointing at a local directory displays index page if there's one
    in src/{local.[ch],main.c,widget.h} [JR, XResource by GN]
  Stoplists - block sites by meddling with cache entries in src/cache.c [JR]
  OpenDocument shortcut configurable via XResource in src/{main.c,widget.h}
    [JR]
  Comment parsing - treat JavaScript as commentary in libhtmlw/HTMLparse.c
    [GN, further streamlined by WBE]
  Submit buttons should transmit VALUEs in libhtmlw/HTMLwidgets.c
    Scott K. Lindsay <SLindsay@Certicom.CA>
  URL encoding fixed - escape +s when turning ' 's to '+'s in src/url.c [GN]
  Cache handling fix in src/cache.c
    J.D.Coleman <J.D.Coleman@newcastle.ac.uk>, JR and GN
  Signal handling fix in src/main.c [JR and GN]
  Spelling errors, Help page, default Home page, INSTALL instructions updated.
    INSTALL, lib/{help.html,home.html}, libhtmlw/{HTMLamp.h,HTMLparse.c},
    src/{convert.c,main.c,stringdb.c} [GN]
  App'defaults file lists all resources in one place in src/Chimera.ad [GN]

beta 1 (WBE)
------
HTMLformat.c: hardened code against stray text in <table>...</table> region
    that was not in a <td>...</td> or <th>...</th> (e.g., <pre> spaces and
    linefeeds) in pages with badly broken HTML.
HTML.c: LF still part of an anchor, but ignored for anchor display or select

alpha 2 (WBE)
-------
DeferPix toggle button added and delayImageLoad resource commented out.
Print, Pretty Print, and Select now seem to work.
  libhtmlw/HTMLformat.c:
     Completely new PrintTextToString replaces both PrintTextToString and
     PrintPrettyTextToString; strcpy_or_grow changed; ToCol() added.
  libhtmlw/HTML.c:
     Print(Pretty)TextToString calls fixed (arguments changed).
Changed parser to recognize <!--   --> long form comments & flush completely.
Changed &nbsp translation from \040 to \240.  It works properly now.

alpha 1 (Winston Edmond (wbe@shore.net))
-------
Despite the claim that "Table support is not complete, but works amazingly
  well", I found it worked poorly on the sites I happened to visit, so I
  spent some time making it much better.
Tables now work *much* better.  It has the following features:
  * arbitrarily nested tables
  * arbitrary number of columns and rows per table
  * allows multi-line table items
  * supports "width=" (including "width=X%")
  * supports "colspan="
  * supports "cellpadding="
  * implicit table tags (for bad/broken HTML)
  * handles double-quotes around integer values in table tag parameters
  * (internal) 1 pass + retroactive fixup implementation
  * (internal) doesn't create intertag formatted spaces for "</td>  <td>"

LocateElement anchor search adjusted for tables.
Refresh substantially optimized; PlaceLine now takes region to update.
		       ------------------------------
Applied all patches to 1.65 from "chimera-patches" file as of Jan. 17, 1997:
  * Extra ISO escapes by Jim Rees <rees@umich.edu>.
  * Color allocation bug fix by Jim Rees.
  * OpenDocument shortcut by Jim Rees.
  * Many bug fixes by Roman Czyborra.
  * Initial table support by clif@clif.ypsi.mi.us (Clif Flynt).

1.66 - 1.69
------------
numbers skipped.  The addition of substantial table support seemed like a
big enough change to merit rounding the version number up to 70.

1.65
------------
beta 14
-------
Fixed redefinition problem with XtCColumns in mxw/XtCColumns.
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
Fixed definition of ParseCommaList in libhtmlw/HTMLwidgets.c.
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
Added line to Common.tmpl.dist for Solaris 2.x
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
Added #include <time.h> to gopher.c
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>

beta 8-13
---------
Changed strdup() in libhtmlw/HTMLwidgets.c to XtNewString().
Changed all of the memory allocation guys in libhtmlw to the Xt
  versions.
Added common directory to deal with code common to everything.  This
  is used for now as a way to call XtMalloc() from non-X code so
  that all memory errors go through the UI code.  Or something.
Fixed up the gopher code.  Now it converts 1 and 7 types to HTML
  on the fly instead of buffering and then processing.  Should be
  much faster and efficient but it probably won't be noticable
  except on the slowest of machines.  Just needed to get rid of
  get_line().  Should have done it this way all along, of course.
Got rid of get_line() in util.c.
Fixed mistake in widgets.c where home was supposed to be back.
  David DeSimone <fox@convex.com>
Got rid of bcopy and bzero in the libhtmlw and xloadimage code.
Auth password field sets echo to False.
Bookmark group is remembered after it is dismissed and reopened.
Added for support for named submit buttons.
Improved (hopefully) handling of HTTP error codes.  In addition,
  the document status is used to improve document/error handling.
  For example, download errors will be displayed instead of saved.
Removed some of the fields from Document.  The fields are fetched
  from the MIME field list.  Eventually all fields will be handled
  this way.
General transparency code changes to inline.c from the god of transparency!
  Michael Kellen <michael@xph029.physics.montana.edu>
More transparency changes.  xloadimage/xpixmap.c this time.
  Michael Kellen <michael@xph029.physics.montana.edu>

beta 7
------
Fixed a few problems with the Imakefiles.  Reported by
  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>
Added patch to EscapeURL(). Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
  Could this be the last one?
Added patch to inline.c to add more content-types for images.
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
Moved the URLencoding of forms data to http.c.  Got sick of looking
  at it in main.c where it didn't belong.
Fixed problem in MailCommand().
Move XtAppSetWarningHandler() (or something like that) after XtRealizeWidget().
  Michael Kellen <michael@xph029.physics.montana.edu>
Added patch to make the 0 part of bitmaps the background color.
  Michael Kellen <michael@xph029.physics.montana.edu>

beta 6
------
If the directory for a cache info entry does not exist then the cache
  cache info entry is ignored.  I find this useful for the times when
  I have local disk on one machine so I want to use it for a cache but
  on other machines I do not have access to local disk so I have
  a generic entry at the end of the cacheinfo file.  This is besides
  the fact that it just makes sense to ignore entries if the directory
  doesn't exist. 
Made some fixes for SCO systems.  Can't remember who reported this.
Added XtAppWarning() to the bookmark code and chimera now at least
  registers handlers for warning and error messages.
Added URL encoding patch from David Robinson. (drtr@ast.cam.ac.uk)
Added extra info when the "source" button is pressed.  Worthless but
  it might be interesting.

beta 1-5
--------
Got rid of the __STDC__ ifdef's and used the _ArgProto thing for
  prototypes.
Created the StrReq, Bookmark, and OutputSel widgets to replace the goofy
  strpop, lister, and filepop things.  Huge code improvement.  Bookmark
  guy works differently, though.  Allows the bookmark filename to
  specified as "| program" so that the user can create their own
  bookmark file format and have the bookmark widget read it.
Create AuthReq to get the username and password from a username for
  documents that require authentication.  This guy gets a little
  screwed up when transients are decorated...you have to move the mouse
  to the fields by hand.
Fixed case sensitivity problem in libhtmlw.
   David Robinson. (drtr@ast.cam.ac.uk)

1.64
------------
Beta 7
------
Fixed horrible bug in Reload().  Gareth Owen <oweng@aston.ac.uk>
Added some code to ftp.c to return error messages.  It feels strange
  adding usability code to chimera.
Fixed problem in ReadInput() in input.c.
  Atsushi SHIMIZU <shimizu@nttvdt.hil.ntt.jp>
Added XtOverrideTranslations() to main.
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
Fixed '#foo' URLs.  Again.  Had to do with the anchor field not being
  preserved when the document was already in the cache.  Or something.
Added "Raw" selection to the file menu.  It does the same thing as
  the "HTML" selection (saves the raw data) but some people saved
  to "Plain Text" to get the raw stuff (which makes sense).
CHILD_STDERR commented out of options.h.  If CHILD_STDERR exists then it
  is treated as a filename otherwise the parent's stderr is used.
Can now save to a pipe in the file popup by putting '|' on the front.
Provided reasonable (hopefully) titles for the transients.
Fixed default cache directory name booboo.
  j braham levy <braham@csc.umist.ac.uk>
Fixed GIF reading problem.  j braham levy <braham@csc.umist.ac.uk>
Incorporated fancy new ScrollingText widget from aXe.
Fixed problem with <select></select>.  Fixed code in MakeWidgets() in
  libhtmlw/HTMLwidgets.c.  Code gives me the willies.
Added scrolling text widget to the HTML wdiget.  This required some
  reworking of the code and I regorganized it a bit to make it easier
  to work on.  It is still scary but more manageable.
Password field makes characters invisible by making the the foreground
  the same as the background.  Allowed removal of chunk of code
  from HTML.c and simplied HTMLwidgets.c.
Changed ftpEmail to email because it can be used anywhere not just in ftp.
Added helpful hints to INSTALL. Winston Edmond <wbe@psr.com>
Added code to sort local and FTP directory listings.
  Vincent Broman <broman@Np.nosc.mil>
When read() returns 0, ReadLine() now returns -1.
Added gamma correction for inline images.  BUG: transparent color gets
  gamma corrected.  Fix with background X resource.  Set with
  Chimera.gammaCorrect.

Beta 1-6
--------
Cleaned up some stuff in main().
Removed redundant code from OpenURL().
Fixed problem with the '#foo' URL guys.  The anchor field in URLParts
  wasn't being copied in MakeURLParts() and MakeURL().  Also, for
  some reason the target_anchor argument for HTMLSetText wasn't working
  for me so I used HTMLAnchorToId() and HTMLGotoId() which is wrong
  but it works.
Added 'd->cache = 0' to file().  Again.
Added a line for JPEG inline images. Nicolas Pioch <pioch@Email.ENST.Fr>.
Fixed problems with caches using the same directory.  See
  ScanCacheDirectories() in cache.c.
Updated the README files, INSTALL, and lib/help.html.
Added compat/ to the distribution to hold functions that don't exist
  on some machines.  Change Common.tmpl, src/Imakefile, Imakefile.
Changed the bogus mystrcmp() calls to strcasecmp().
Added missing mtlist argument to ProxyProtocol().
  Bill Jackson <bj@impact.xerox.com>
Removed unneeded argument to DoLister() in main.c
  Bill Jackson <bj@impact.xerox.com>
Shortened gopher titles.
Chimera dumps core when you press "L" in the source view. The Reload
  function in main.c had better not call LoadDoc when t->up==NULL
  fixed. Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
Enchanced error messages. David Robinson <drtr@ast.cam.ac.uk>
Added ftpEmail X resource. Tim Bradshaw <tfb@edinburgh.ac.uk>
Fixed no_proxy X resource problem. Tim Bradshaw <tfb@edinburgh.ac.uk>

1.63
------------
Fixed error that caused endless recursion in CreateImageInfo()
Added CHILD_STDERR #define so that the stderr of child processes canb
  be sent someplace useful.
Changed the first line in the util/access_* scripts.
Added (unsigned char *) to calls to EscapeURL().

1.62
------------
Cleaned a lot of stuff up that isn't listed here.
Code in http.c can now handle caseless methods (GET, PUT,...)
Changed xloadimage/options.h to xloadimage/xloptions.h
Hardcoded size of view widget when SELECT is used because I kept getting
  a zero widget size and it would exit.
When the search code finds something it will position it in the middle of
  the viewport instead of at the very top.
Escaping of URLs should work better.
The URL handling changed again.  Hopefully it is in good shape now...seems
  to work well.
Added cacheIgnoreExpires X resource.
Now pays attention to the 'Expires' field.
Multiple caches can be specified with different charactertistics.  The
  "old" way of doing things is still supported using the old (but slightly
  changed) X resources.
Added handling of WM_DELETE_WINDOW
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
When 'Location' or 'URI' appear in a response from the server, the cache
  is consulted first to check to see if the document is cached.  It used
  to grab the document from the source no matter what.
noProxy and allProxy resources added.
Added 'all_proxy' so only one proxy variable has to be set for all protocols.
Fixed bogus _PROTO mistake where _NO_PROTO was supposed to be in Common.tmpl.
Changed util/Imakefile so that MakeDir wasn't used.
Fixed bug in MakeURLParts() that caused URLs to inherit path info from
  the part URL even though they have different protocols.
Added to code to main() so that chimera can handle stuff like
  'chimera mumble.html'.  Added getcwd() to util.c with #ifdef
  in case some systems need it.
Fixed src/Imakefile. Markku Savela <msa@hemuli.tte.vtt.fi>
Patch to net.c for Solaris machines to include file.h.
  Gareth Owen <oweng@aston.ac.uk>
Hardcoded (whine, whine) some MIME types so that chimera can identify
  some file: and ftp: documents without the mime.types file.
Hardcoded (whine) a convert entry so that chimera doesn't need a convert
  file to handle text/plain stuff.
Snarfed strstr() from the Tcl distribution and added NEED_STRSTR to
  Common.tmpl.
ext wasn't being used in URLParts so it was removed.
Added 'extern int errno' to the appropriate files in src/.
Moved the HAVE_xxxxxx_H's to Common.tmpl.dist so that all directories see
  them and removed them from options.h.dist.
Added patch for 16bit displays.  davidh@use.com
Added scrolling patch. asami@cs.berkeley.edu
Fixed authentication problems.  If the server returned a relocation
  status then chimera wanted the user to reenter the auth info.  Also,
  if invalid auth info is entered, chimera won't repeatedly send the
  information to the server (it will prompt for new info).
X Bitmap reading code works now.
Fixed HandleDoc so that all documents go through ConvertDocument().  The
  reason this needs to happen is for documents that needed to have
  a content or transfer encoding decoded.
Inline images work on monochrome displays now.
Reworked the convert code.  The convert file is simpler and the
  convert code is simpler.
Added PNM code to the xloadimage directory.
Added XPM code to the xloadimage directory.  Its slow seems to work
  for XPM3 images.
Added HAVE_xxxxxx_H's to options.h.  This is bound to cause trouble
  and piss people off but at least now compilations can be done
  with 'gcc -Wall' and there is a chance there will be no
  warnings.
Fixed bug in main().  Not enough args specified.
The default bookmark group is now the first bookmark group in the
  group list.
Changed the default cache directory to /tmp.  Changed the cleanUp
  default to True so that cache files do not get left laying around.
Tested with term 2.2.8 and it seems to work fine.  Chimera requires
  version 2.x (I'm not sure about versions earlier than 2.2.8, though).
  Some changes were made to options.h.dist and net.c.
giftrans removed (no longer needed)
Fixed incorrect prototypes in net.h.
  Jim.Rees@umich.edu
Fixed problems with the Imakefiles and a prototype in main.c
  Dean Huxley (dean@fsa.ca)
Chimera can now handle GIFs directly.  The number of colors in an
  inline image can be reduced using the "maxColors" resource.  The code
  for XBM is there but it doesn't work.  Monochrome screens are kind
  of support...most images end up being garbled but some work out
  OK.
Changed the way MIME stuff is parsed.  It is still extremely primitive
  but made ParseHTTP() much easier to deal with.  ReadCache() also
  changed.  Now there is a MIMEField field in Document.  This contains
  a list of all the MIME fields even if chimera doesn't know what they
  mean so that the fields can be passed to other programs.  I'm not sure
  how useful it is.
Cache files no longer have HTTP/1.0... as the first line.
Added patches to file(), ReadLine(), and ReadInput().
  Thomas Eberhardt <thomas@mathematik.uni-Bremen.de>
Replaced net_write() with WriteBuffer() which deals with non-blocking IO.
Renamed ReadInput() to ReadBuffer() to make things consistent.
Replaced the #if NeedFunctionPrototypes with #ifndef _NO_PROTO.
Removed includes from auth.h.
FTP uses WriteBuffer, ReadLine, and ReadBuffer so the cancel button works
  and the code is cleaner.
Added patch to close ALL descriptors in ConvertDocument() now.
  J.D.Coleman <J.D.Coleman@newcastle.ac.uk>
Fixed places where the content-type of the document wasn't being set.
The bookmarks can now be grouped.  In fact, there has to be at least one
  group.
Changed test-chimera to look something like the way Nicolas.Pioch@enst.fr
  had it at one point.  Now uses XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and does not screw
  up the server variables.  Jim Wight <J.K.Wight@newcastle.ac.uk>.
Added <sys/types.h> to util.c
Create lang.c and stringdb.c to deal with alternate language stuff and
  to provide a way of passing environment strings and X resources around.
Added X resources for httpProxy, ftpProxy, gopherProxy, nntpProxy, newsProxy,
  urnProxy, waisProxy.
The authentication code changed again.  Chimera will download auth
  pages twice...once to find out the realm and once to pass in the
  authentication information.  There is a short cut allowed...entire
  directories and its subdirectories use the same username and password.
  Chimera doesn't use this, however, because using the realm for all
  documents make coding consistent and simple.  Chimera also looks at
  the hostname, protocol, and port in case another site is using the same
  realm to grab the auth info.  Only Basic is supported.
Changed help.html to explain delayImageLoads.  Removed DELAY_IMAGE_LOADS
  from options.h because it wasn't used.
No longer have to move the cursor to the text widget in a string popup.
  The focus is set correctly.
Fixed a problem with the delayed image load code.
Made a change to ConvertDocument so that it doesn't cause a Seg fault
  when the converter isn't in the path or otherwise unavailable.
Cleaned up the document and url structures and their utility functions.
Added CACHE_AUTH so that caching of authenticated documents can be
  activated at compile-time.  The user is responsible for the security
  of their own cache directory.

1.61
----
Pages that require authentication are no longer cached.
Gopher menus and searches now have a heading as well as a title describing
  what the document is about.
Fixed ParseURL() to look for '/' before anything else because people
  can put seriously funky things in the filename part as long as the
  slash is first.
Fixed spelling errors in help.html.
Removed #include <Xm/XVaSimple.h> (or something) from libhtmlw/HTML-PSformat.c.
Added some software requirements to INSTALL.
Added hints for Alpha AXP OSF/1. (Still doesn't work...at least on 2.0)
Reworked the network I/O stuff to get rid of the stdio routines.  Stdio is
  used for file I/O but the "regular" UNIX stuff is used for network I/O
  so that select() can be used.  This required that ReadPipe() no longer
  use popen().
Made changes in document.c to check to make sure that absolute URLs
  are supplied when required.
The transfer status should now show the total bytes for HTTP/1.0 and FTP
  but not for cache reads.
Added a patch from Azuma OKAMOTO <lfo@sayori.dais.is.tohoku.ac.jp> to
  WriteCache().
Made nasty hacks to please the URN people.  Chimera can, I think, pass
  URNs to a URN proxy.
Added patch to EscapeURL() from "J.D.Coleman" <J.D.Coleman@newcastle.ac.uk>
  I need to learn more about international character stuff.
Gopher code processes the Gopher+ stuff on the fly instead of buffering
  and then parsing.  Hope gopher servers can handle a connection being
  closed before end of input.
Documents in subdirectories do not have to be authenticated once
  the parent has been authenticated.  UNTESTED.
Made changes to accomodate TERM 2.x.  UNTESTED.
  Andy Moskoff <andy@wx.gtegsc.com>
Fixed missing </h1> in header for gopher search.
Added patch to access_nntp provided by Rob May.  UNTESTED.
Added patch to http_main() that fixed a possible seg fault.
  Azuma OKAMOTO <lfo@sayori.dais.is.tohoku.ac.jp>
Modified the protocol and hostname handling code in MakeURLParts() to
  make sure that a protocol and hostname was present in all URLParts
  processed by MakeURLParts().
Rearranged the entries in lib/home.html into an obnoxious UNLV-centric
  way.

1.60 prerelease 18-real release
-------------------------------
Fixed main() to create a fake context URL in case the command line
  specified URL is relative.
ReadInput() now accepts FILE * instead of a descriptor.  It also allows
  line input.
ParseHTTP() now uses the fancier ReadInput() to parse HTTP as it is
  loaded which seems to save a lot of time.
Changed Common.tmpl so that configuration is easier.
Replaced my ParseURL() with one written by
  Rob May <robert.may@rd.eng.bbc.co.uk>.  Modified it a bit to match
  changes in URLParts.
Changed dotelnet and do3270 to match changes in URLParts.
Added support for "Basic" and "user" authentication.  Needs work.
Fixed SubmitForm() in main.c to make it replace all spaces with
  '+'
Made some changes so that the labels for the popup menu in the file
  requester can be changed and things will work right (just check it
  out...it is a pain to explain).
Added some resources in fallback.c (which was created) so the the
  file requester and bookmark requester will look good without the
  app-defaults.
Changed the function calls to WriteCache(), ReadCache(), and
  LoadDocument() to get rid of bogus arguments.
Changed ImageResolve() to use LoadDoc() to eliminate duplicate code.
Changed the string popup so that the pointer warps to the text field.
  This is done after the popup window is put on the mouse cursor
  so that the warp is not bad.  Should probably just put the text field
  under the cursor in the first place...
Wrote another ParseURL() using Rob May's code.
Made changes to FixFilename() as supplied by Rob May.
Initialized d to NULL in LocalProtocol().
Made ParseHTTP() read until end of input because the Content-length is
  wrong for a good number of the documents served.
Calls HTMLFreeImageInfo() so that image data gets free'd.
Fixed MakeURLParts() so that the extra fields get copied to the new
  URLParts.
Made some changes to the gopher to make it work better.  I really hate
  gopher.
Made CreateCommandLine() to create command lines to pass to system()
  and popen().
Made change to call to http_proxy() in document.c  rup and up were
  switched again.  Rob May.
Documents are flushed from the cache if they get too old and their
  link is checked when a page is displayed.  What this means is that
  links will only be dashed when the document will be fetched
  from the cache.

1.60 prerelease 17
------------------
Fixed BASE handling code in ImageResolve.
Fixed bug in url.c.  username and password in URLParts wasn't getting
  initialized.  Created CreateURLParts() to make initializing consistent.
The default port is now 0 instead of -1 in URLParts.  -1 was bothering
  me.

1.60 prerelease 16
------------------
Fixed Imakefile problems for X11R4 users.
Fixed bug in proxy code in ProxyProtocol in document.c
  robert.may@rd.eng.bbc.co.uk
Made md5.c compile with non-ANSI C compilers.

1.60 prerelease 12-15
---------------------
Added statusUpdate resource to control how often the download status is
  displayed.
Made change to telnet_main as recommended by robert.may@rd.eng.bbc.co.uk.
  Note: I do not really worry about telnet URLs so if you are interested
  in them then you'll need to take care of bugs yourself...I'll add patches
  but I don't test them.  My philosophy: telnet URLs suck and I don't
  want to deal with them.
Made changes in the util directory to remove the .script extension from
  scripts so that they can be executed when test-chimera is used.
Incorporated Mosaic 2.4 widget.
Made changes to the way arguments to gopher*(), http(), ftp(), ... are
  called so they are more reasonable.
Changed the name of the content file to convert to better reflect what
  it is used for.
Changed some file resources to be colon-delimited lists of files.  This
  was suggested by someone on bug-chimera but I don't remember who.  The
  resources end in 'Files'.
Improved (?) error reporting.
Changed the help file and [some of?] the documentation to reflect changes
  to chimera.
Applied fix to the gopher code from Armin Buehler
  <armin@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE>
Made changes to src/Imakefile (set library dependencies correctly) and
  libhtmlw/HTML.c (to do line-by-line scrolling).  NOTE: changes in the
  widget break this feature...I'll fix it later.
  Satoshi ASAMI <asami@cory.EECS.Berkeley.EDU>
Finally added delay image loads.  Several people contributed this
  code (hint, hint) but I used the code from
  Paul Kern <pkern@utcc.utoronto.ca>.  There was pretty much one way to
  do it.
Added support for the BASE tag.

1.60 prerelease 10-11
---------------------
Minor thrashing around.  Do a diff :)

1.60 prerelease 9
-----------------
Took some configuration stuff out of Common.tmpl and stuck it in
  options.h.
Change the Imakefile in util to make the target for giftrans correct.
Got source for HTMLformat.c and HTMLwidgets.c so input TYPE="hidden"
  is handled.  Michael Kellen <uphrrmk@oscs.montana.edu>
Replaced 'mailcap.types' with 'mailcap' in lib/Imakefile.
Made the option menu in forms appear with the default selection instead of
  the name.
Fixed a problem which caused some documents to get chopped short in
  ParseHTTP().
Added external protocol handlers.  An NNTP handler program was written by
  jeff@isri.unlv.edu.
ReadPipe() replaces pipeit() and is cleaned up in the process.
Changed FixFilename() to return a static string instead of malloc'd
  memory.  This made code in other places a bit cleaner.
Fixed problems with lib/Imakefile and moved some configuration into a
  header file.

1.60 prerelease 8
-----------------
Added a cancel button.  Changed main.c, ftp.c, gopher.c, and http.c.
Added input.c to handle the network input for gopher.c, http.c, ftp.c.
Added argument to DisplayTransferStatus so that total size can be
  displayed.
Fixed a problem in ReadContentFile() where the next pointer in a structure
  was not being set to NULL.  Reinhard Stix <stix@bau2.uibk.ac.at>
Made the gopher module aware of filename extensions.
Fixed cache.c so that the cache off environment vars/resources really work.
Cleaned up stuff in main.c to make the URL and Title displays work
  correctly and did other general cleanup.
Fixed lib/Imakefile so that mime.types is installed.
  Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer <fritz.heinrichmeyer@fernuni-hagen.de>
Changed Common.tmpl* to allow the NO_SELECT guy to be set.
Added test-chimera so that testing chimera in place is easier.
Fixed dest->tencoding = src->encoding in TransferDocument().
Added giftrans so that transparent GIFs can be handled.  giftrans
  written by Andreas Ley <ley@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>.
Added chimera-giftoppm and made changes to the content file to handle
  transparent GIFs.  <Nicolas.Pioch@enst.fr>
Inline images are now reloaded when a document is reloaded.
Moved the utility programs to their own directory.
The userContentFile entries now take priority over the contentFile entries.
  Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer <fritz.heinrichmeyer@fernuni-hagen.de>
Made changes to dotelnet, do3270, and local.c to make telnet URLs work better.
  Nathan Torkington <Nathan.Torkington@vuw.ac.nz>
Made changes in the way the content file is handled and made conversion
  to plain text and external program.  This involved a lot of stuff.
Added fromcache to the document structure to detect when documents
  have been processed.
Created urlgrab at the suggestion of Benno.  Type: urlgrab URL and the
  document is grabbed and stuck in the default cache directory or the
  directory indicated by the appropriate environment variable.
Made more changes to main for the cancel button.  While I was at it I
  decided to mangle main.c again.  There was a problem with Reload()
  that prompted this.
Mucked around with URLParts handling.  Now fields that aren't in the
  URL are NULL instead of "".
Made modifications to mime.types.
Combined Save and Print into one requester created by PrintSave in popup.c.
  Got rid of requester.c and replaced it with popup.c.  GetString() in popup.c
  now handles the Open, Search, and other single string guys.  This is
  good because it simplies main.c a lot and the Print/Save guy makes
  much more sense.
Modified the cache file format.  Cache files now look like HTTP/1.0 from
  an HTTP server with extensions.  The extensions can be ignored.
Made modifications to ParseHTTP to make it handle the new format of
  cache files.  Made modifications to the arguments so that they made more
  sense.
Modified ProcessDocument() to make it handle the 'http' type in a
  [hopefully] better way.
Added code to read the EMAIL environment variable if it is set to use
  for the email address for ftp access.  This is mostly for TERM users.
Change soak() in ftp.c to use ReadInput so that the user can interrupt
  the ftp protocol stuff and not just the data transfer.
Changed ReadMIMETypes() to check for the number of fields returned
  from the sscanf().
Changed to MD5 for the cache filename hash.  The old hash was giving
  errors.  MD5 will be needed for the auth stuff anyways...
  condit@isri.unlv.edu.
Added Mail button in the file requester.

1.54
----
Fixed memory allocation/deallocation problems in ftp.c and gopher.c that
  caused chimera to dump core.
Made ChangeDocument a little more flexible.  It is used more often
  to change the innards of documents so that you don't have to know
  what is inside.
Changed a bunch of code to use ChangeDocument to partly eliminate
  direct manipulation of the Document.  Made a bunch of gratuitous
  changes along with this just because I felt like it.
Added ISO8859-1 to the end of the font strings for non-US users.  This
  may cause problems (?) for R4 and earlier users so the old fonts are
  commented out at the bottom of Chimera.ad.  This was suggested by
  Marc Baudoin baudoin@ensta.fr.
Changed Porthole.h to Porthole.c in mxw/Imakefile.
  Rob May <robert.may@rd.eng.bbc.co.uk>
Fixed the unbelievably stoopid mistake of leaving ANSI arguments in BSFunc.
  This was pointed out by many folks on The List.
Changed Common.tmpl so that all configuration stuff can be done there.  It
  looks kind of ugly and it makes for long compile command lines (is
  this going to be a problem?) but it seems to work.
Fixed several calls to realloc_string() in MakeURLParts().
Changed 'file:' to 'file' in MakeURLParts().
Changed some code in main so that old URLs are replaced with the
  possibly changed URL from the newly loaded document.  For example,
  when HTTP returns the Location: field the URL can change.
Fixed the SetSensitive code so that the Reload button is disabled
  at the right time.
Replaced the two occurances of MakeDocument with ChangeDocument and
  removed MakeDocument.  MakeDocument was redundant.
Changed the content-type handling code to use only the MIME content-types.
  This required the stuff in mime.c to read the mime.types file.  Each
  access method is now responsible for returning the content-type for
  returned documents.
ReadContentDB now allows a second content file to be specified which
  allows a user content file to be used.  The default is ~/.chimera_content.
  Can be specified with the resource *userContentFile.
Added an experimental feature that allows local programs to be called
  with user input from a form as its arguments.  See the content file
  for sketchy details.
Changed gopher.c so that \r\n is sent with requests instead of just
  \n.  Suggested by Gareth Owen <oweng@aston.ac.uk>.
There may have been some other changes that I forgot about.

1.53
----
Changed the help page to explain the environment variables and resources
  used by chimera.
Changed ParseURL to return "/" instead of "" if no filename is specified.
Changed MakeURLParts to put NULL in fields of newly allocated structure
  to fix bug reported by Mike Kenney <mike@wavelet.apl.washington.edu>
Added resources for CHIMERA_CACHE, CHIMERA_CACHE_SIZE, CHIMERA_CACHE_OFF,
  CHIMERA_DOC_TTL.  Changed CHIMERA_MAX_SIZE to CHIMERA_CACHE_SIZE.
Moved the cache code into cache.c and cleaned it up a bit.  The cache
  functions are now called from the user interface code so there is
  better control of the cache.
Cleaned up document.c after creation of cache.c.
Cache now caches processed versions of documents.  Right now this only
  benefits inline image documents.  Benefits plaintext docs, too.
Leading spaces on URLs are ignored.
Got sick of the config script.
Fixed <title></title> bug reported by Nicolas Pioch <pioch@inf.enst.fr> and
  "Lee A. Butler" <butler@arl.mil> (supplied patch).
Fixed problem in MakeURL reported by Gareth Owen <oweng@aston.ac.uk>.
Added DisplayCurrent() in Reload().
Thrashed around in MakeURLParts().
Fixed the buildup of <plaintext> for text documents.  This easy fix
  causes text files to take up twice the memory and disk, unfortunately.
  Fix later.
Fixed memory leak in SubmitForm()
Added delete highlighted text when backspace is pressed for the requester.
  I do not think that this patch changes existing behavior so it
  shouldn't make anyone mad.
  patch by Nathan Torkington <Nathan.Torkington@vuw.ac.nz>
Made changes to Common.tmpl and Imakefiles as suggested by
  George White <gwhite@astra.bio.dfo.ca>.  I actually did things a bit
  differently.
Changed ifdef's to use SVR4 as well as SYSV.
Fixed the FORM stuff.  It was broken in an incredibly bad, silly way.
  I am ashamed.  Required change in SubmitForm().
Changed AddDocNode so that the HTML widget is refreshed only when a new
  HTML document is loaded.
Added code to http.c, file.c, document.c, and document.h to deal with
  Content-encoding and Content-Transfer-encoding.  It is assumed that
  the transfer decoding should happen first and then the regular
  decoding should take place.  Also it is assumed that the content file
  has entries for the decoder (like zcat for x-compress) and that
  it is configured as a pipe.  Not really a restriction I guess.

1.52
----
Rewrote ParseURL because it was a mess and to make the arguments
  cleaner.  Removes length limitations on URL parts.
Added support for the no_proxy environment variable.
Added disk-based cache.  Removed old nasty cache (cache might be too strong
  a word for what was used before).  Added new environment
  variable called CHIMERA_CACHE which specifies the cache directory.
  Changed config to prompt user for more information about cache.
  Added cache parameters to conf.h.dist.  The existence the environ var
  CHIMERA_CACHE_OFF turns the document cache off.
  If CHIMERA_CACHE_SIZE is zero then there is no limit.  If CHIMERA_DOC_TTL
  is zero then documents are not flushed because of their age.
  I like absurdly long environment variable names.
Decreased the frequency of the transfer counter.
Changed the way the application resources are installed.  I did
  this after suggestions made by Jim Wight <J.K.Wight@newcastle.ac.uk>.
Added code so that the Pragma statement is sent to proxy servers when
  appropriate.
Changed the way URLs are handled.  They are now shipped in a structure
The third mouse button causes info about an anchor to be displayed.
  Currently it only provides the URL of the anchor.
All memory allocations go through functions in util.c.  If malloc fails
  then it is handled in util.c since at that point there is not much else
  to be done.
URLs can be entered in the URL display window.
Fixed a zillion little bugs.
pstopxm patch added.  Benno Blumenthal <benno@rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu>

1.51
----
Removed the 'contentPath' line from Chimera.ad and changed the scrollbar
  resources slightly.
Fixed a problem that caused Chimera to use POST when it shouldn't.
  Required minor changes in http.c and main.c.
Fixed the font definitions in Chimera.ad.
Added proxy support for HTTP, Gopher, FTP, and WAIS.  Note that WAIS can
  be proxied but it won't be done natively.

1.50
----
Fixed Imakefile bogosities
  Arne H. Juul <arnej@pvv.unit.no>
Redirected stderr (and sometimes stdout) to /dev/null for content file
  commands
Changed defines for bcopy in src/net.c, libhtmlw/HTMLP.h, pbmplus/pbmplus.h
  R. Stewart Ellis <ellis@nova.gmi.edu>
Changed local.c so that file://localhost/blah will work.
Changed file.c so that if the document is empty external programs are not
  created and pipes are not opened to converters.
Changed the bookmark code so that changes to the bookmark list are saved
  immediately.
The chimera distribution directory name reflects the version.
Changed the resources file a bit.
Fixed a URL problem where something like <a href=~john> would not work
  because the URL ended up like http://blah~john instead of
  http://blah/~john.
The visited URL code now looks in the document cache to determine if
  the document has been visited.
Fixed the the URLs like <a href=blah.gif><a img=blah.gif></a> so that
  they work as expected.  Fixing this sort of uncovered a massive memory
  leak which I exploit to make the URLs work right.  At least the
  memory will eventually get free'd when it gets flushed out of the cache.
  Eventually.  Hopefully.  The cache needs fixing.
Fixed the press scroll-key-shortcut in the scrollbar crash problem (huh?).
  Unfortunately, you must make sure that the cursor is in the main
  viewing area before the scroll key shortcuts will work.
Fixed a problem in gopher.c that caused seg violations.
Fixed a problem in ftp.c in soak() which caused seg violations.
Fixed a gopher problem that caused chimera to report errors even when
  there wasn't one...it was using gopher+ return codes when the gopher
  protocol was used.  Probably needs more work.
Will accept ~/ and ~user/ as filenames for saving and for loading local
  files.

1.49
----
Fixed the cache search broken in 1.48.
Added a patch for TERM stuff in net.c in the function net_read.
  Bill Reynolds <bill@goshawk.lanl.gov>
Added m2c to convert the Mosaic hotlist file to the chimera bookmark file
  format.  Anthony Starks <ajs@merck.com>
Added code to deal with multiline greetings and messages from ftp servers.
  Look at soak() in ftp.c.
Fixed code in MakeRequester to prevent seg faults when the user tries
  to add a bookmark for a document which doesn't have a URL
  (error, info messages).
Changed HandleDocument to eliminate some unnecessary screen refreshes
  and so that the scroll bar isn't reset to the top after an external
  document is loaded and displayed.

1.48
----
Added patches to main.c and url.c from Jim Rees which fixed a memory
  allocation error and a URL construction problem.
Added patches to net.c and INSTALL for term from
  Tom Boutell <boutell@netcom.com>
Fixed a problem in gopher.c when dealing with the things like '1/' (now
  it wants '11/').
Made the config script work a little better and included SOCKS options.
Fixed a memory leak in gopher.c.
Fixed a search string problem in gopher.c.
Made the title for gopher documents work better.
Fixed the url#link stuff that was broken in 1.47.
Added key shortcuts.
  Charles Hedrick <hedrick@klinzhai.rutgers.edu>
Changed document.c so that the cache ignores the '#' stuff.

1.47
----
Fixed problem in SubmitForm (main.c) so that it handles the isindex stuff
  correctly.
Fixed a bug in http.c.  #links were appended to the filename.
  Charles Hedrick.
Added patches from "R. Stewart Ellis" <ellis@nova.gmi.edu> to make
  the config script more flexible and to add TERM support to the
  main sources.  It also made compilation on SYSV machines work better.
Changed main.c so that the command line URL is used before the URL
  specified by WWW_HOME. Benno Blumenthal benno@ldgo.columbia.edu
Put alternate resources in src/Chimera.ajs.ad. Anthony Starks <ajs@merck.com>
Fixed unbelievably poorly written mystrcmp and mystrncmp.  Grrr.
Fixed the '..' code in url.c.  Again.
Fixed the config script.
Changed the JPEG instructions in INSTALL.
Changed gopher_to_html and gopher_main to make them a bit smarter.
Changed the content file to so that the gopher selector type works.
Fixed the middle button download requester and the unknown file type
  requester.
Probably some other stuff I don't remember.

1.46
----
Fixed the gopher problems which were introduced in 1.45.
Fixed a bug with gopher selectors that start with '/' instead of '1/'
Added the ftp patch provided by Jim.Rees@umich.edu.
Changed the way requesters and listers are dealt with.  If a requester
  is already activated and the user clicks on the same command then the
  requester is raised.  If the user clicks on a different command then
  old requester is deleted and the new one pops up.  The lister works
  the same way but there is currently only one lister.
  Also, if the requesters remember the last string and there is a
  clear button.  Requesters now have a clear button.
The Add button for the bookmark list now brings up a requester in case the
  bookmark title is bogus.

1.40-1.45 (1.40-1.44 were never released to the public)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Made the bookmark popup act very much like a famous WWW browser which uses
  Motif.
Removed bogusness from Common.tmpl.
Changed src/Imakefile to use -g and -Wall if gcc is being used.
Changed some resources to match lister changes.
Added patches for local.c, gopher.c, and file.c from
  "R. Stewart Ellis" <ellis@nova.gmi.edu>
Made some fixes to src/content.c to make sure bogus matches aren't made
  in GetContent.
Added "file * text" to lib/content.
Added search capabilities.  This needs to be refined to allow forward and
  backward search and case-sensitive searching.  Right now it only allows
  forward, case-insensitive searching with wrapping.
Added print capabilities.
Cleaned up code in various files.
Added code to make the #id links into a document work.  Not really well
  tested but it seems to work.
Added resources in Chimera.ad to make the screen gray and change the
  font.  The resources need to be uncommented first.
  Looks especially good with Xaw3d.  Provided by ajs@merck.com.
Added information to the INSTALL file.
Changed the help file to reflect changes to the user interface.
Added code to do the POST stuff correctly so FORMS support is more complete.
Changed the XtAppPending loops in main.c to XFlush.  XFlush probably
  isn't as good but I had problems with callbacks being made in the
  middle of callbacks which was nothing but trouble.
Added code to make '..' in URLs.  This is modelled on code from
  Yap Kid Mun <KidMun.Yap@mel.dit.csiro.au>
The bookmark list would not popup when there were no bookmarks which
  meant that you could never add bookmarks...this is fixed.

1.38
----
Fixed tmpnam related bug in file.c
  Bob Smith <bob@snuffy.penfield.ny.us>
Hacked on lib/help.html a bit for no reason.

1.37
----
Cursor turns into a watch when Chimera is busy.
Added code to make messages and cursor change occur right away
  Yap Kid Mun <KidMun.Yap@mel.dit.csiro.au>
Used the scrolling text widget for the URL and title displays.
Changed ifndef sun in libhtmlw/HTMLparse.c to ifndef NOSTDHDRS
Added a line to find the length of the text from gopher_to_html in gopher.c.
Changed box widgets for the URL and Title displays to forms and chained
  things together so the text widgets resize with the main window.
  MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE THE RESOURCES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Jim Wight <J.K.Wight@newcastle.ac.uk>
Put in new pstoppm from benno.
Fixed seg fault problem in DisplayDocNode in main.c
  Yap Kid Mun <KidMun.Yap@mel.dit.csiro.au>
Hacked gopher_to_html in gopher.c to allow missing fields in the gopher info.

1.36
----
Added this CHANGES file (what a witty guy <cough>).
Added -D_NO_PROTO to libhtmlw/Imakefile.
Changed the INSTALL file very slightly for no reason.
Took the #if XRELEASE crap out of the mxw source code and created mxw/X11/Xaw.
Removed NULLs to tmpnam so strange machines don't cause problems.
Made use of NOSTDHDRS for stdlib.h.
Changed some bogus code from local.c which involved a variable called
  buffer which wasn't being initialized.  This should help telnet
  accesses.
Added pstoppm which does a better job of dealing with postscript inline
  images.  Changed src/Imakefile and lib/content to support this and removed
  src/epswrap.script since it was no longer needed.
  pstoppm was written by Benno Blumenthal benno@ldgo.columbia.edu
Made changes to the end of MakeURL in url.c to make URL building better.
Made changes to LoadDir in local.c to make it handle dirs with / on the end.
  Should probably always kill trailing /'s so it only has to be
  dealt with once.
Stuck the new ScrollText.c from J.K.Wight@newcastle.ac.uk into mxw.
Removed string.h from every file.  Why?
Added 3270 stuff to src/document.c and added src/do3270.script.  Changed
  lib/content to deal with 3270.  Bob Smith <bob@snuffy.penfield.ny.us>.

0.0 - 1.35
----------
Screwed around with some code and eventually ended up with the mess I call
Chimera 1.35.  A LOT of contributions were made by Jim Rees
<Jim.Rees@umich.edu>.
